<!--
It is possible to insert documentation for the whole command,
for the in arguments as a whole, for the out arguments as a whole,
for each error, for each argument (in as well as out).
For the moment, all doc elements are optional.
All elements contain their documentation as a child.
This means that the doc element as child of the command element
holds the documentation for the command as a whole. The in element
holds a doc element that contains the documentation for all in arguments
as a whole and so on.
A doc element can contain paragraphs and lists. Paragraphs are tagged
with the p element, lists are tagged with the ul element.
Paragraphs may hold text (#PCDATA), bold (b element) text, italic (i element)
text and monospace (code element) text.
A list (ul element) holds n listitems (li elements). Listitems hold the same kind
of data as paragraphs (p elements).
Text cannot be placed immediately in the doc element.
The cas element holds that same kind of data as the doc element.

The command element is used for the definition of a SOI command.
It defines an attribute representing the name of the command and the
definitions of the structure for the input arguments and the result. 
Moreover the possible errors are documented in a separate error list.
     	
Attributes: 
	name - the name of the command

<!--	
Reference to another command or argument. (for documentation purposes)
Contents of the element gives further explanation  Use this element whenever a parameter is associated with reference data and state the corresponding reference data read-command.
	
Attributes:
	item - '/' separated path to command or argument 
 	e.g. "COMMAND.READ/in/cs_id" or simply "COMMAND.READ"

<!-- 
Definition of a nested parameter list. 
 	
This list is both used for the definition of in parameters to and the output of a command.

Note: there is no "mandatory" attribute here - it means a list is always optional
	
Attributes:
	name - the name of the argument
 	minlength - the minimum length of the list
 	maxlength - the maximum length of the list. An asterisk "*" is used to denote that 
 	            the list may have arbitrary length
